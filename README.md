Final Project

AI Image Enhancement Web Application

<br>1 - Implementation of Enhancement Tasks:
<br>Image Denoising:
<br>• Load a pre-trained denoising model from Hugging Face.
<br>• Fine-tune the model on the noisy image dataset.
<br>• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
<br>Image Super-Resolution:
<br>• Load a pre-trained super-resolution model from Hugging Face.
<br>• Fine-tune the model on the low-resolution image dataset.
<br>• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
<br>Image Colorization:
<br>• Load a pre-trained colorization model from Hugging Face.
<br>• Fine-tune the model on the grayscale image dataset.
<br>• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
<br>Image Inpainting:
<br>• Load a pre-trained inpainting model from Hugging Face.
<br>• Fine-tune the model on the damaged image dataset.
<br>• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
<br>
<br>2 - Integration and Deployment:
<br>• Integrate the fine-tuned models into a single system.
<br>• Develop a user interface (UI) for users to upload images and select
<br>enhancement tasks.
<br>• Deploy the system as a web application using frameworks like Flask or
<br>Django.
<br>
<br>3 - Evaluation and Testing:
<br>• Evaluate the system using the test dataset.
<br>• Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
