USD AAI-521: Applied Computer Vision for AI
Final Project

AI Image Enhancement Web Application

1 - Implementation of Enhancement Tasks:
Image Denoising:
• Load a pre-trained denoising model from Hugging Face.
• Fine-tune the model on the noisy image dataset.
• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
Image Super-Resolution:
• Load a pre-trained super-resolution model from Hugging Face.
• Fine-tune the model on the low-resolution image dataset.
• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
Image Colorization:
• Load a pre-trained colorization model from Hugging Face.
• Fine-tune the model on the grayscale image dataset.
• Evaluate and refine the model performance.
Image Inpainting:
• Load a pre-trained inpainting model from Hugging Face.
• Fine-tune the model on the damaged image dataset.
• Evaluate and refine the model performance.

2 - Integration and Deployment:
• Integrate the fine-tuned models into a single system.
• Develop a user interface (UI) for users to upload images and select
enhancement tasks.
• Deploy the system as a web application using frameworks like Flask or
Django.

3 - Evaluation and Testing:
• Evaluate the system using the test dataset.
• Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
